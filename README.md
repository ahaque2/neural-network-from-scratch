# Neural Networks from Scratch

In this series, we learn different concepts about deep learning by implementing neural networks from scratch.
To get started, follow the steps:
- Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/ahaque2/neural-network-from-scratch.git)
- install the requirements (install -r requirements.txt)
- Open any Jupyter notebook and run
